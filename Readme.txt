Hi, thanks for reviewing this. I have 1 question about this tasks. Actually, the last one.
I received some errors like: "Property 'value' does not exist on type 'Event'.",
when i want to get value of emitted event. I found the solution but i'm not sure if it's
right to use it. I manually defined type of any for my event targets. Let me know if
it's wrong to use this solution please (i just didn't find any better that would work for me).
